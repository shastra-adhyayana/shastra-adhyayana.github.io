# Pratyaksha

In the [previous](001-intro) section, we described pramaa (knowledge). 
We now deal with the first means of knowledge (pramana), 
which is pratyaksha pramanam.

Generally, we think of pratyaksha pramanam as the senses of sight, 
hearing, smell, taste and touch. Through this, we see color, hear sounds etc.

Vedanta however says that the knowledge generated through pratyaksha pramanam
is brahman. This is quoted in the brihadaranyaka upanishad -- 'yat saakShaat aparokShaat brahma'.

How do we now think about the sense of sight, and the color that we perceive?
Vedanta says that chaitanyam is indeed pratyaksha pramaa. The modifications
of the mind (antaH karaNa vRtti) which evelope this 
chaitanya (avacChedakatvaat) are also spoken of as gyaana. Thus, pratyaksha
gyaana is chaitanya alone. But, via gyaanatvopachaara, pratyaksha pramaana
is the vritti of the mind.
