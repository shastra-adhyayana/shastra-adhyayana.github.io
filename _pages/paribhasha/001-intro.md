# Introduction

All human pursuits are undertaken with our quest of happiness in mind.
They fall within one of the four purusharthas. i.e. dharma, artha, 
kama or moksha.

Of these, moksha is the ultimate purushartha, since it alone is permanent.

1. kama -- we experience the impermanence of desire in everyday life
2. artha -- we experience the impermanence of wealth in everyday life
3. dharma -- vedas tell us that punya runs out and is impermanent
4. mosksha -- vedas tell us that moksha is permanent

We have thus established that dharma, artha and kama are all temporary.
And moksha is permanent. Thus, that is what we should pursure. Since we
achieve moksha through brahma gyana, we need to study three topics. The
vedanta paribhasha does this in 8 chapters.

## Pramaa

Moksha is achieved through knowledge of brahman. Before discussing this in 
particular, we need to have an understanding of how we gain knowledge. All
knowledge (pramaa) must be produced by a suitable means (pramaana).

What is pramaa (knowledge)? That whose subject is anadhigata and abaadhita.

1. anadhigata -- not previously known
2. abaadhita -- not superceded by later knowledge (i.e. not erroneous)

### anadhigata (not previously known)

We've defined knowledge as that which is not previously known. A person might
focus on an object for an extended period of time. Even if it is unknown at
first, it is surely known at the end of that period of time. This knowledge
doesn't fit the definition.

In vedanta, when you focus on an object for an extended period of time, it is
a singular knowledge. You aren't repeatedly seeing the object. Rather, the
same singular knowledge of the object remains in the mind until another 
knowledge replaces it. i.e. there is an 'antaH karaNa vRtti' which stays in
place.

### abaadhita (not erroneous)

We've defined knowledge as that which is not contradicted later on. 
But, vedanta defines objects we interact with as 'mithya' which is
contradicted by brahma-gyana for a gyani. Thus, knowledge of objects
does not fit the definition.

In vedanta, even though objects might be mithya, knowledge of them is
valid in samsara. As far as the definition is concerned, it is talking
only of 'baadha' that occurs within samsara. Thus, knowledge of objects
in everyday life is valid.

This line of reasoning is common in daily life. Even though we agree
that we are not the body, we still identify with it. We say
'I am a boy' or 'I am here', and that is correct knowledge. In the same
way that we restrict ourselves to our time in a single body and consider
that to be correct knoweldge; we now restrict ourselves to our time in
samsara and that too is indeed correct knoweldge for the duration.

### conclusion

The author has dealt with potential problems with both of the important
clauses of the definition of pramaa. i.e. anadhigata and abaadhita. Thus,
we now have a definition of pramaa, and can now consider the means for
knowledge (pramanam).

## Pramana

Vedanta accepts six valid means of knowledge, i.e. pramana. They are:

1. pratyaksha
2. anumaana
3. upamaana
4. aagama
5. arthaapatti
6. anupalabdhi

The author first deals with direct perception -- pratyaksha pramana.
